# Prompt:
Give the latest details of the Leviste List.  Focus on what to expect on what will happen next.  Elaborate on the which politicians wants the case closed and those who demand deeper investigation.  This will indicate which politicians are at risk and those who are not involved. 

# Response

The "Leviste List" has rapidly evolved into a major political standoff following its public release on **December 24, 2025**.

The list, technically known as the **"Cabral Files,"** refers to digital records (spreadsheets) allegedly obtained by Batangas Rep. Leandro Leviste from the late DPWH Undersecretary Maria Catalina Cabral. These files detail billions of pesos in "allocables" or budget insertions for infrastructure projects in the 2025 budget, exposing a system of "pre-ordered" contracts and district-specific quotas.

The following is the latest breakdown of the situation, expected next steps, and the political lines being drawn.

### **Latest Details (As of December 25, 2025)**

* **The Release:** On Christmas Eve, Rep. Leviste released summary files showing that **P401.3 billion** in DPWH funds were "allocated" to specific district representatives. When including insertions from the Senate, Executive branch, and other proponents, the total questionable amount allegedly balloons to over **P1 trillion**.
* **The "Allocables":** The list suggests a quota system where congressmen are given a guaranteed budget (allegedly **P150 million minimum** per district) to identify projects for, often disregarding the executive's original National Expenditure Program (NEP).
* **The Smoking Gun:** Leviste claims the files identify specific legislators who "inserted" projects outside of the standard process, often benefiting specific favored contractors.

### **What to Expect Next**

1. **Ombudsman Intervention:** The DPWH has already turned over Cabral’s computers and files to the **Office of the Ombudsman**. Expect the Ombudsman to cross-reference Leviste’s released summary with the raw data to validate the "allocables." This moves the case from a purely political mudslinging contest to a potential criminal investigation for plunder or graft.
2. **Committee Clashes:** Leviste has filed resolutions to investigate specific contractors. Expect procedural battles in the **House Committee on Public Accounts**. The chair of this committee (or its members) may attempt to block hearings or strip Leviste of his platform, citing "parliamentary courtesy."
3. **Selective Leaks:** Leviste indicated he has more detailed files. Expect a "drip-feed" of specific names and project details in early 2026 to keep the pressure on, particularly targeting vocal opponents.

---

### **Political Stances: Who Wants it Open vs. Closed**

The controversy has split the House into two clear camps: those pushing for a purge of the "old system" and those fighting to protect the status quo (and their budget allocations).

#### **1. Demanding Deeper Investigation (The "Offense")**

* **Rep. Leandro Leviste (Batangas 1st District):** The primary whistleblower. He is risking political isolation to expose the "allocables" system. His strategy appears to be bypassing the House leadership by going directly to the public and the Ombudsman.
* **House Minority Bloc:** Several minority members have filed resolutions to investigate independent of the majority, seeing this as an opportunity to weaken the ruling coalition's grip on discretionary funds.
* **Sen. Panfilo "Ping" Lacson:** While not leading the charge, he has clarified that **newly elected Senators (from the 2025 midterms)** are *not* involved, effectively washing his hands of the 19th Congress's budget mess and subtly supporting the cleansing of the previous roster.

#### **2. Resistance & Deflection (The "Defense" / At Risk)**

These politicians are either directly implicated or are actively trying to discredit Leviste’s narrative to stop the probe.

* **Rep. Terry Ridon (Bicol Saro Party-list):** The most vocal opponent. Leviste accused him of having budget insertions despite not being a sitting congressman at the time the budget was crafted. Ridon has called Leviste a "liar" and challenged the authenticity of the "piecemeal" release.
* **Rep. Edwin Gardiola (CWS Party-list):** Explicitly named by Leviste as having "pre-ordered" **P20 billion** in projects. He is highly "at risk" as the investigation focuses on specific contractors linked to him.
* **Rep. Zaldy Co (Ako Bicol):** Mentioned in reports as a major proponent of projects. As the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee during the budget crafting, he represents the establishment that oversaw the "allocables" system.

### **Risk Assessment: Who is Safe vs. Involved**

| **Status** | **Profile of Politicians** | **Why?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High Risk** | **Contractor-Linked Party-Lists** | The "Cabral Files" allegedly link specific party-list reps (like CWS and Bicol Saro) to specific construction firms (e.g., Ibasco-owned firms). If the Ombudsman matches the budget release to these specific contractors, it is a direct line to graft charges. |
| **Moderate Risk** | **District Representatives with "Excessive" Allocations** | Congressmen whose districts received DPWH budgets significantly higher than the P150M-P500M "standard" (some allegedly in the billions) will face scrutiny to explain the variance. |
| **Low Risk / Safe** | **Newly Elected Officials (2025)** | The 2025 budget was crafted in 2024 by the **19th Congress**. Officials who assumed office *after* June 30, 2025 (freshman senators and reps replacing incumbents) are technically clean of the *preparation* of this specific budget. |

**Summary for You:** The situation has moved past rumors. With the files now in the Ombudsman's hands, the "At Risk" politicians are those specifically named as having "outside allocables"—meaning they inserted projects beyond what the DPWH engineers recommended.

### **Relevant Video**

This video is relevant as it features Rep. Leviste explicitly naming Rep. Edwin Gardiola and detailing the mechanics of the "pre-ordered" projects, which is central to the "High Risk" category mentioned above.


# Prompt

In light of this recent incident provide insight on which 2028 potential presidential contenders are the winners and the losers.

# Response

The release of the "Leviste List" (Cabral Files) and the broader "Flood Control Scandal" has fundamentally reshaped the 2028 playing field. The exposure of a **P1 trillion+** web of insertions, "pre-ordered" projects, and substandard infrastructure has turned public sentiment violently against the current House leadership and, by extension, the administration coalition.

Here is the breakdown of the **Winners and Losers** for the 2028 Presidential race based on the current fallout.

### **The Losers: The "Status Quo" Coalition**

The scandal has effectively decapitated the leadership of the 19th Congress, making any candidate associated with the "budget architects" radioactive.

**1. Rep. Martin Romualdez (Lakas-CMD)**

* **Verdict:** **Biggest Loser / Political Casualty**
* **Why:** Even before this specific list, Romualdez had already been forced to resign as Speaker in September 2025 due to the mounting pressure of the flood control investigation. The "Leviste List" drives the final nail in the coffin of his 2028 presidential ambitions. As the leader during the budget's crafting, he is viewed as the "Captain of the Ship" that facilitated the allocables system.
* **Consequence:** He has lost the moral ascendancy to launch a national campaign. His machinery (Lakas) is powerful, but his personal "electability" has cratered.

**2. The "Administration" Standard Bearer (Marcos Proxy)**

* **Verdict:** **Severely Weakened**
* **Why:** Former Appropriations Chair **Zaldy Co** (now a fugitive/whistleblower himself) has employed a "scorched earth" defense, alleging that the P100 billion insertions were ordered by President Marcos and Romualdez. This drags the President directly into the mud.
* **Consequence:** The President’s endorsement power for 2028 is diluted. Any candidate he anoints will be attacked as the "heir to the corruption."

**3. The "Bicol Bloc" & Associated Party-Lists**

* **Verdict:** **Eliminated**
* **Why:** Figures like Zaldy Co (Ako Bicol) and Edwin Gardiola (CWS) were once kingmakers who could deliver millions of votes. They are now the "face of the scandal." Their ability to mobilize command votes for a 2028 candidate is paralyzed by legal battles and public ire.

---

### **The Winners: The "Cleansers" & Outsiders**

The 2028 race is now shifting away from "continuity" toward "accountability." Candidates who can distance themselves from the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA) stand to gain the most.

**1. VP Sara Duterte (HNP/Independent)**

* **Verdict:** **Biggest Winner**
* **Why:** The scandal validates her split from the Romualdez-led House. When she was stripped of confidential funds and attacked by the House leadership in 2024-2025, she painted herself as a victim of their politicking. Now, that same House leadership is exposed as corrupt. She can now run on a platform of "I told you they were rotten," effectively presenting herself as the only "strongman" alternative to a corrupt legislative system.
* **Strategy:** Expect her to remain silent or vague, letting her enemies destroy each other, then emerge as the "law and order" candidate.

**2. Sen. Panfilo "Ping" Lacson**

* **Verdict:** **Resurgent Contender / Kingmaker**
* **Why:** As the Chair of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigating this, Lacson is back in his element as the "sleuth" and "budget watchdog." He is successfully differentiating the "clean" Senate (especially the new 2025 entrants) from the "corrupt" House.
* **Consequence:** Even if he doesn't run for President, his endorsement will be the "Gold Standard" for anti-corruption. He effectively holds the power to absolve or condemn 2028 hopefuls.

**3. Sen. Raffy Tulfo**

* **Verdict:** **The Populist Beneficiary**
* **Why:** The core of this scandal is *flood control*. Flooding affects the masses (C, D, E crowds) the most. Tulfo’s brand is built on solving the immediate grievances of the poor. He can channel the public rage against "substandard dams" and "ghost dredging" into a powerful populist campaign without needing to get into the technicalities of the budget.

**4. Rep. Leandro Leviste**

* **Verdict:** **Rising Star (Senatorial/VP Prospect)**
* **Why:** While too young for 2028 presidency, he has successfully rebranded himself from a quiet solar entrepreneur to a national "slayer of giants." By taking down the "old guard" (Co, Gardiola, and indirectly Romualdez), he positions himself as the future face of a "cleaned up" administration slate.

### **Summary of the Shift**

| **Pre-Scandal 2028 Narrative** | **Post-Leviste List 2028 Narrative** |
| --- | --- |
| **"Unity vs. Opposition"** | **"The Clean vs. The Corrupt"** |
| Romualdez was the likely Admin bet. | Romualdez is out; Admin scrambling for a new face. |
| Infrastructure ("Build Better More") was a selling point. | Infrastructure is now a liability (viewed as a source of corruption). |
| **Winner:** The candidate with the biggest war chest. | **Winner:** The candidate with the cleanest hands (or the best ability to point fingers). |

**Implication for You:**
If you are tracking market or political stability, expect **volatility**. The "UniTeam" is dead. The administration is fracturing into warring tribes (Marcos wing vs. Romualdez wing vs. Duterte wing). This paralysis may delay legitimate infrastructure projects, affecting construction stocks and government contracts until the 2028 dust settles.
